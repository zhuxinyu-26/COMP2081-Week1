    <h2 id="Etymology">Etymology</h2>
    <p>
      "Boiler plate" originally referred to the maker's label used to identify
      the builder of steam boilers.[1] In the field of printing, the term dates
      back to the early 1900s. From the 1890s onwards, printing plates of text
      for widespread reproduction such as advertisements or syndicated columns
      were cast or stamped in steel (instead of the much softer and less durable
      lead alloys used otherwise) ready for the printing press and distributed
      to newspapers around the United States. By analogy, they came to be known
      as 'boilerplates'. One large supplier to newspapers of this kind of
      boilerplate was the Western Newspaper Union, which supplied
      "ready-to-print stories [which] contained national or international news"
      to papers with smaller geographic footprints, which could include
      advertisements pre-printed next to the conventional content.[2] Some
      companies also sent out press releases as boilerplate so that they had to
      be printed as written. The modern equivalent is the press release
      boilerplate, or "boiler," a paragraph or two that describes the company
      and its products.

      In contractual law, the term "boilerplate language" describes the parts of
      a contract that are considered standard. Boilerplate language may also
      exist in pre-created form letters on the Internet for such things as
      issues to be broached by a politician based on an issue ad, requests that
      a cable or satellite operator add a cable network to a system, pre-written
      complaints about a product that is opposed by groups that create such
      letters, or online petitions. The person requesting the action usually
      only needs to type or sign his or her name at the end of the pre-written
      greeting and body.

    <h2 id="BoilerplateCode">Boilerplate Code</h2>
    <p>
      In computer programming, boilerplate is the sections of code that have to
      be included in many places with little or no alteration. Such boilerplate
      is particularly salient when the programmer must include a lot of code for
      minimal functionality. The need for boilerplate can be reduced through
      high-level mechanisms. A related phenomenon, bookkeeping code, is code
      that is not part of the business logic but is interleaved with it in order
      to keep data structures updated or able to handle secondary aspects of the
      program.
